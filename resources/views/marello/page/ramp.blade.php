              <h4>Marshalling</h4>
              <p>
                Aircraft marshalling refers to the visual communication between ground personnel and pilots in order to lead an aircraft to the correct parking position. Marshalling is important, because the pilot has limited vision both of the aircraft and of ground obstacles from the cockpit.
                <br>The person in charge of marshalling gives a signal to the crew by using paddles (marshalling lights at night time) in order to stop the aircraft in the correct parking spot.
